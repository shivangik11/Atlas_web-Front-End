# Class Portal: Milestone 1


### Ideation
I'm considering making my class portal into a class portfolio that exhibits my work by documenting the process, ideas, sketches, and concepts behind the projects. I want to make something that I can utilize to launch my professional career as a product or user experience designer. The primary objective is to paint a clear picture of my thinking process. I'd want to work according to the current needs and specifications. The class portfolio should demonstrate my strong hands for technician skills as well as critical thinking abilities. 
I aim to be responsive and simply available from all conceivable displays; my portfolio should reflect my personality and ability to work with bright and vivid colors and features. 
The landing page should have a brief introduction to each project, and clicking on any of them will take you to an in-depth look at the project, including the process, code, wireframes, high-fidelity prototypes, and concepts.

### Interactive Features
A daylight button to make it interactive, the button will be used to change the black and white theme of the portal. Usage of hover effect. I will be looking for more such features to put into the portal and make it more interactive.

### Color Scheme
The main goal is to demonstrate how I can manage various color palettes, whether they are contrasting colors or tints and tones of the same color. 
For the homepage page, I want to use black and white to create great color contrast, and the remainder of the pages will use various combinations of bright and bold colors.
