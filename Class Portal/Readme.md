# Class Portal: Milestone 1


### Ideation
I'm considering making my class portal into a class portfolio that exhibits my work by documenting the process, ideas, sketches, and concepts behind the projects. I want to make something that I can utilize to launch my professional career as a product or user experience designer. The primary objective is to paint a clear picture of my thinking process. I'd want to work according to the current needs and specifications. The class portfolio should demonstrate my strong hands for technician skills as well as critical thinking abilities. 
I aim to be responsive and simply available from all conceivable displays; my portfolio should reflect my personality and ability to work with bright and vivid colors and features. 
The landing page should have a brief introduction to each project, and clicking on any of them will take you to an in-depth look at the project, including the process, code, wireframes, high-fidelity prototypes, and concepts.

### Interactive Features
A daylight button to make it interactive, the button will be used to change the black and white theme of the portal. Usage of hover effect. I will be looking for more such features to put into the portal and make it more interactive.

### Font 
I am planning to use ‘Menlo’ it’s a very open-ended font commonly used in websites.

### Color Scheme
The main goal is to demonstrate how I can manage various color palettes, whether they are contrasting colors or tints and tones of the same color. 
For the homepage page, I want to use black and white to create great color contrast, and the remainder of the pages will use various combinations of bright and bold colors.

# Milestone 2

For milestone 2, I began by learning the fundamentals of HTML and CSS, as well as how to construct a website and all potential functions and style inputs. I began by mapping out how to connect different sections and how the website should look. It took me a while to understand the linkages between the pages and how to connect the pages to one other. 
I began by creating the first page in HTML utilizing all of the functions I had previously learnt. I was very meticulous about the formatting and size of each block. I was able to put everything pixel to pixel with the help of Adobe XD. 
Back to back I started creating HTML pages and CSS pages and started linking each one of them with each other. Making a responsive website was a task, was able to make it with the help function called flex and flex wrap. 
after all the pages were coded and styled, I checked multiple times correct names of different pages and if all the pages are working or not. Binding all the pages together I was able to see my class portal wokring properly. I filled in the LAB 1 assignment in the class portal and linked it with git also.

I struggled with the page layout at first, but with the help of a few tutorial videos, I was able to put everything together on the landing page. 

After establishing the HTML for the landing page, I began working on the page's aesthetic. One of my goals was to make it as responsive as possible, so I started using rem and em for styling from the start. I was able to learn lot of things with this assignment which helped in my further assignments.
## Final coded Class Portal
