##LookBook

Creating a website on your own is a demanding task. So many things to consider, from color combinations to font types, styling fonts, font sizes, image placements, and so on. So here I am, pondering a solution. Creating a webpage that will allow you to customize your webpage immediately and be as creative and interactive as possible. 
Lookbook is a type of webpage where you can experiment with different colors, fonts, and placements to create your own designer webpage before coding it.

Initially, I struggled with designing and creating web pages at the same time. This page would be really useful for anyone who want to explore it while also coding it. 

I want to make the website more interactive so that users may experiment with the various possibilities presented by the page.
