# Milestone 1

## LookBook

Creating a website on your own is a demanding task. So many things to consider, from color combinations to font types, styling fonts, font sizes, image placements, and so on. So here I am, pondering a solution. Creating a webpage that will allow you to customize your webpage immediately and be as creative and interactive as possible. 
Lookbook is a type of webpage where you can experiment with different colors, fonts, and placements to create your own designer webpage before coding it.

Initially, I struggled with designing and creating web pages at the same time. This page would be really useful for anyone who want to explore it while also coding it. 

I want to make the website more interactive so that users may experiment with the various possibilities presented by the page.

# Milestone 2

for milestone 2  I am now working on the functioning prototype of the lookbook. In addition to this, I have been working on the xd program, which assists me in comprehending the design viewpoint of the page and provides me with a prior knowledge of the measurements of the page that are pixel perfect. 
In response to the feedback that was provided, I have added a feature that enables the user to view predefined examples on the page that was provided. I have put up a lookbook that is two pages long. 
In the first page, users will be able to experiment with the page using the options that have been provided in order to produce an engaging landing page. In the second page, users will be able to refer to examples that have been provided, and with the assistance of those examples, they will create a landing page.
