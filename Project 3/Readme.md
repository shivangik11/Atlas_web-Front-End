## Milestone 1

### Ideation
Project Topic: Single-page web application for course registration using React.js.

The project's goal is to develop a practical/real-world application. As students, we all use or have used the online course registration tool. I believe the time has come to construct one. In this application, students can choose from a list of available courses, browse through each course, view detailed information, add the course to their cart, and complete the registration process. The app will have multiple pages such as a course cart page, a registered courses page, and so on. We can demonstrate what we've learned about React.js and how to use concepts like creating react components and using react router to create single-page web apps with this project.

### Features
1. Browse course list
2. Course detail page
3. Add course to cart
