## Milestone 1

I want to use react to create an interactive website portfolio and make it as dynamic as I can. 
As a user experience (UX) designer, one of the JS libraries that is very much in demand is react, and I want to learn it and add it to my skill set so that I can take advantage of its popularity. My primary objective for this assignment is to study react. And I believe that developing something that is very much connected and will allow me to experience myself as well as making an interactive website portfolio will assist me in learning the principles of the website as well as having a basic concept of what it is.

Creating a portfolio with the assistance of new skills will help me to use it as much as possible. This is something throughout which I can showcase my work and can have the use of this project at the same time. Portfolio is something that I can make in use as I am looking for full-time opportunities. Creating a portfolio with the assistance of new skills will help me.

The look and feel of the website: I am considering putting my information on the website, such as what I do and what my goals and focus areas to work on are. I am not very sure about the look of the page, but this is something I am trying to put out there. I am still learning this software, and I am not sure how this is going to turn out. I'm not able to show how the interactive aspect is going to be with this, but I really want to explore animation with react and give it a feel for my portfolio. Here is a sketch of something that I want to follow up on.
